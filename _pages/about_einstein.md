I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Holmes Lab](https://holmeslab.rutgers.edu/) at the [Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research](https://sites.rutgers.edu/cahbir/), Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, US.

Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Psychology at Yale University.

I earned my BSc in Cognitive Neuroscience in 2014 from University of Bordeaux, and my Ph.D. in Neuroimaging from University of Bordeaux in 2020 in the [GIN](https://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/) Lab under the main supervision of [Nathalie Tzourio-Mazoyer](https://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/about-us/history/nathalie-tzourio-mazoyer-md-phd/).


My primary interest lies in exploring the mechanisms underlying hemispheric complementarity, particularly how these mechanisms are established, vary among individuals, and influence brain-behavior relationships. Additionally, I am curious about whether these differences contribute to the distinct manifestations of psychiatric illnesses.
