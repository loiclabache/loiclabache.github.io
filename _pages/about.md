I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Holmes Lab](https://holmeslab.rutgers.edu/) at the [Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research](https://sites.rutgers.edu/cahbir/), Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, US.

Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Psychology at Yale University.

I earned my BSc in Cognitive Neuroscience in 2014 from the University of Bordeaux, my MSc (Engineering Degree) from the Graduate School of Cognitive Engineering at Bordeaux INP in 2017, and my PhD in Neuroimaging from the University of Bordeaux in 2020 in the [Neurofunctional Imaging Group](https://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/) under the main supervision of [Nathalie Tzourio-Mazoyer](https://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/about-us/history/nathalie-tzourio-mazoyer-md-phd/).

My primary interest lies in exploring the mechanisms underlying hemispheric complementarity, particularly how these mechanisms are established, vary among individuals, and influence brain-behavior relationships. Additionally, I am curious about whether these differences contribute to the distinct manifestations of psychiatric illnesses.
